# Objective
Use Terraform to deploy a highly available simple web application in the AWS Public Cloud infrastructure. Create this simple application as part of the task â€“ this can be created in the language of your choice and should be of 'hello world' level complexity.


## Solution should contain

- All associated files for both the application and infrastructure 
- Specification of all software assumed, including versions
- Documentation, including a README.md file explaining the precise steps required to deploy and destroy the solution

### Prerequisites

- An active AWS account
- AWS CLI installed, and configured with AWS access keys. For more information, see the [Install of update the latest version of the AWS CLI](- Aws CLI
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) documentation.
- Terraform installed. For more information, see the [Install Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install?product_intent=terraform) documentation.
- Node.js v20.9.0 or later installed. For more information, see the [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download) documentation.
- Git installed and configured. For more information, see the [Git documentation](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)

The solution should be deployable from any system configured with these basic software prerequisites.

## Requirements
Solution should meet the following requirements:
- The deployment should be scalable and cost optimised
- The deployment should be able to withstand the loss of a single application component
- The deployment method should be capable of bringing up and tearing down the entire infrastructure, repeatedly
- You may deviate from the main task if you have an innovative solution you would like us to see (if so please document how you have deviated from the brief and why)

It should be well documented (and specifically how easy it is to handover). Further to this, you can do more as following:
- Explaining your thought process
- Maintaining a secure approach to both the deployment code and the deployed infrastructure
- API calls made by the web Application - e.g. fetching a 'quote of the day' or 'getting the local weather'
- Thoughts on how you would maintain your chosen solution, both for uptime and for new releases of the application
- Ability to reuse your chosen solution
- Thoughts on how you would improve on your chosen solution
