# http_api
This is sample rest http api serverless framework deployment with aws lambda python3.8 and api gateway without proxy integration. This solution ingest Data from an api using Lambda with python 3.8 runtime, parse that data and return the response to AWS Api Gateway with REST HTTP. This solution selects default aws region eu-west-2


## Problem Statement
This problem does have 2 parts. First one is to write python script and parse the data as per requirement and serve it as http api. In this solution we are only completing Part 1.

### Part 1
Write some code to fetch cat facts from the cat facts API: http://158.247.202.14:4141/facts
Filter the resulting data so that only cat facts where the cat age is lower than 10 years old and the second name begins with a specific set of letters. The set of letters is every other letter in the alphabet starting from A, e.g: A, C, E, G, â€¦
Now serve this data up from your own HTTP API.

### Part 2
Write a cli tool that can be used to query cat facts from your new API, and also to delete entries. Allow outputting data in JSON, YAML, and table formats if time permits.
Mentione below is the part 2 solution design.

### Pre-requisites

- You need AWS Account with admin user to avoid permission problems.
- You must have centos or amazon linux 2 or you can use other distributions but require to search equivalent packages.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
### Getting Started

This project contains the aws resource definition for:
- A Lambda Function with python 3.8 runtime that will hit Cat api and get the data, this data will be parse and then will be return in the form of json.
- IAM Roles and CloudWatch logs for Lambda Function
- S3 bucket creation
- AWS REST HTTP API Gateway with lambda integration to serve the response of lambda as rest http api.


### Deployment Instructions
