# Scenario:
Your company has a web application that is hosted on AWS using EC2 instances behind a load balancer. The company has asked you to improve the application's security by implementing secure access to the EC2 instances.


## Challenge:

### Implement secure access to the EC2 instances:
- a. Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to enable secure remote access to the EC2 instances without opening inbound ports in the security group. 
- b. Configure IAM policies to ensure that only authorized users have access to the EC2 instances using Systems Manager Session Manager. 
- c. Test the secure access to the EC2 instances to ensure that it's working as expected.
    
    
### Ensure security and compliance: 
- a. Implement AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to ensure that only authorized users have access to the application and its resources. 
- b. Implement AWS Config to audit and monitor any changes to the environment and ensure compliance with industry regulations. 
- c. Implement AWS Shield to protect the application against DDoS attacks and other security threats.

### Improve monitoring and visibility: 
- a. Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the EC2 instances' CPU, memory, and disk usage to identify any performance issues. 
- b. Use CloudWatch to create alarms to notify you of any unusual behavior or potential issues. 
- c. Use AWS CloudTrail to log and monitor any API activity and changes to the environment.

## Deliverables:
- a. A detailed report of the implementation of secure access to the EC2 instances, including a description of the IAM policies and test results.
- b. Documentation of the security and compliance measures implemented.
- c. A monitoring plan outlining the monitoring and visibility improvements made to the environment.
